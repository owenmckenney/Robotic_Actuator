# Robotic_Actuator

This robotic actuator provides high torque and speeds at a reasonable cost. It utilzes a moteus r4.11 bldc driver and a mj5208 brushless motor and has an 8:1 reduction. The components used are outlined in the BOM. This actuator can be controlled through multiple different methods outlined in the moteus documentation, however the files in this repo assume usage of a raspberry pi with a mjbots pi3hat r4.5.
