# Robotic_Actuator

This robotic actuator provides high torque and speeds at a reasonable cost. It utilzes a moteus r4.11 bldc driver and a mj5208 brushless motor and has an 8:1 reduction. The components used are outlined in the [BOM](BOM.md). This actuator can be controlled through multiple different methods outlined in the [moteus documentation](https://github.com/mjbots/moteus), however the python files in this repo assume usage of a raspberry pi with a mjbots pi3hat r4.5.
